**Overview**









## Tools

[Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - We require this IDE to help us better understand the code base for pysimulavr, as it provides easy run configuration options and good debugging to view runtime data.

[Codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) - The IDE is required to build and run AVR code with Simulavr.

[Wireshark](https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/response-time-viewer-for-wireshark?&CMP=KNC-TAD-GGL-SW_NA_X_PP_CPC_LD_EN_PRODE_DWA-FXNET-982238371~47089245085_g_c_wireshark-e~311972701385~~&ds_cid=71700000047472276&ds_agid=58700004762384593&network=g&device=c&keyword=Wireshark&matchtype=e&creative=311972701385&feeditemid=&gclid=CjwKCAjwqLblBRBYEiwAV3pCJsGS5VyzI4uZv9t4Gt0TOMUX1so0L0jhll_V9zJFfzZ2WghSH7CpdBoCQMYQAvD_BwE) - This tool is used to trace packets between Simulavr and GDB, and also UI port 7777 to understand how simulavr sends data over a socket connection.

[Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)- The development process is being done in a Linux environment, thus we require a virtual Linux environment in our Windows/Mac environments.

[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html?sdid=12B9F15S&mv=Search&ef_id=CjwKCAjwqLblBRBYEiwAV3pCJn7wWU_6f28aW9etyuLHvPFLTGp_FmIsOYplz3kMfpxrvo0BQs2yvRoCUboQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!315233774112!e!!g!!adobe%20xd) - Tool used to create the wireframe designs for the GUI.

[Avr Tool chain](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-c-compilers)- Required libraries and compiler tool chain to execute Simulavr and GDB

[Slack](https://slack.com) brings all your communication together in one place. It's real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams.
